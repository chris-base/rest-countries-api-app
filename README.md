## My process

Started with clean React app, made layouts for both pages (Countries List Page/Individual country info page). Made layouts for both desktop and mobile sized screens. Made interactive sections (Input element for search bar/drop down for region selector). Made API calls using [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2). Added dark/light toggleable.
